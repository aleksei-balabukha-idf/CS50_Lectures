To convert source code (written in C or other programming language), we need Compliler
Compiler is the program that converts source code into zeros and ones.
    to convert our C code into Machine (binary) code we use "make" command,
    which is not a Compiler it self
    it is a sort of utility

header - file which is similar to menu,
    telling our program what function are available


Data Types:
- bool
- char (%c)
- float (%f)
- double - more decimal numbers floats
- int (%i)
- long - bigger integer (%li)
- string (%s format)

in calculator, when we were trying to summarize 2 bln and 2 bln, which would be 4 bln
    we got the wrong answer, since int variables can not hold such big value
    so we used long variable instead
in calculator, when we used floats to divide one value to another,
    we found that if we use significant number of digist after decimal point (50)
    we can see that strange values appear after some number:
    it is called Floating point inPrecision
        it refers to inability of computer fundamentally represent all possible real numbers
        100% precisely at least by default
and if we divide 4 by 3 using int as inputs - .333 part of the result would be truncated
    and as the result we will have 1

the problem of truncation arised in 1 Jan 2000, since in that time only 2 digits were used to reprtesent years
    the solution was to increase capacity take more bits to store longer date format

the similar problem may arise in 19 Feb 2038, since it is more than 2 bln away from 1970
    in terms of 32 bits computer would not be able to count more seconds
    the solution is the same to take more bits 64 and it dramatically increases the amount seconds computer can count



Operators:
+, -, *, /,
% - remainder of division

Variables: Syntactic sugar
#assign variable counter to 0
    int counter = 0;
# add 1 to counter:
    counter = counter + 1;
    counter += 1;
    counter++;
# update the value of variable that has already been created:
    counter = 5
    # we do not nee to remind the data type

Data types

While loop C

For loop:
    there are suttle differences with issues of scope:
    variable, created in for loop exists only inside of that loop


Create functions in C:
    return datatype name of a function(parameters)
    if there are no parameters inside of a function - "void"


do while loop, for example we can ask for input
    till the time the input sutisfies some condition, stated in while section

Types
----------------
how large data types in C:
- bool 1 byte
- char 1 byte
- double 8 bytes
- float 4 bytes
- int 4 bytes
- long 8 bytes
- string ? bytes

RAM - Random Access Memory, which can store some amount of data

If we want to have multiple values stored in memory, there are better way to do this
    rather than creating variable for each of them
- Array - another type of data that allows to store the same types of data contiguously
    int scores[3];
    it does not help to save space, but helps to provide different locations for all values using one variable

    string is an array of chars
    to defferentiate one string from another, we need special character "nul" \0 (8 zero bits)
    so every string is one byte longer due to existance of that symbol


-----------------------------
Command Line Arguments
-----------------------------
How we can run programs that take arguments from a command line?

int main(void) - void actually mean that such program does not take Command Line Argument

Exit status:
    main function in C has an ability to signal to user whether something was succeful or not
    by it's return value
    if we return non-zero value from main,
    it would mean that something goes wrong


-----------------------------
Cryptography
-----------------------------
if we want to hide a the contents of a message from someone who wants to intercept it
like in school we encrypted writen message by changing some letters etc
and the recepient should be able to decrypte it

Plain text - Encrypting Algorithm (Cipher) - Ciphertext
    Cipher typically takes 2 inputs
